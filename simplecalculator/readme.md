1. RUN npm install in a terminal window on the root path /simplecalculator/.
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser.
3. The source JS and SCSS files are under src folder.
4. The compiled source files are under build folder.
5. Run webpack in a different terminal window on the root path /simplecalculator/ to make any changes to the JS or SCSS files so that they would compile.
6. Thank you!
